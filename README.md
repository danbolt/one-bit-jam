## About
This is Daniel's repository for bit jam, hosted by [Daniel Linssen on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/bit-jam).

## Running

This game is written in HTML5/JavaScript with the Phaser 2 library. To run it locally, you'll need to point a web server at this game's root folder. I'm particularily fond of the `http-server` package [found on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

## More Info
